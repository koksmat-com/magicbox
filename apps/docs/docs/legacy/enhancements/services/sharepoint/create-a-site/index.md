## Name your site.
In this example, we named our site My App. You can name your site however you’d like. Perhaps something like **Covid-19 Vaccination Reporting Site**.

Note that you can always rename the site later, but do not change the site address after completing this Recipe. Changing the site address will break relations and links in the finished app; if it is important enough to change the site address, you will need to make other updates to the app and lists after publishing this app.

## Complete the site’s metadata.
Enter a site description so everyone knows the role of the site. If your organization uses sensitivity labels, choose the appropriate label under Sensitivity. 
Click **Finish**.
 
## Your site has been created
Welcome to your new site! You have created the site and can skip through any other prompts SharePoint sends your way, unless you want to use them for anything.
 
The remaining steps in this Recipe can only be completed by an owner of this SharePoint site. Generally speaking, site members and visitors will lack the necessary permissions to complete this Recipe. You can add owners to your site at any time.
