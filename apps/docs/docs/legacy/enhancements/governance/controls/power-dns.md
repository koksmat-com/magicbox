# Power DNS
Which app do we have, who owns them, who can maintain them, what level of support can I expect?

:::note

Start really simple, e.g. by making a List containing PowerApps which can be used, who owns the app and who could be the editors of that.


## List of PowerApps
### List model
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Apps {
        Title string  "The display name of the app, can be changed"
        AppID string  FK "The unique id of the app"
        LifeCycle string  "Life cycle stages - (Blank) > Analyzing > New > Managed > Retracting > Retracted > Deleted "
        OwnerEmail string 
        LastModifierEmail string 
        Created date
        LastModified date
    }

```

### Read list data from PowerShell

```powershell
. "$PSScriptRoot/load.ps1"
. "$PSScriptRoot/.intra365.ps1"


# Provide Site URL and List name
$SiteURL = $env:I365_APP_SHAREPOINTLIST ##  "https://christianiabpos.sharepoint.com/sites/powerapps"
$ListName = "Apps"
  
Try {
# Connect to PnP Online
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteURL -Interactive

# Setup hash
$hash = @{}

# Get List Items
$ListItems= (Get-PnPListItem -List $ListName -Fields "Title","GUID","Life Cycle")  
ForEach($ListItem in $ListItems)
{ 
    $key = "$($ListItem["GUID"])"
    $value = @{
        Title=$ListItem["Title"]
        LifeCycle=$ListItem["Life Cycle"]
    } 
    $hash.Add($key,$value)

}  
 
}
catch {
Write-host "Error occured: $_" -f Red
}


```
