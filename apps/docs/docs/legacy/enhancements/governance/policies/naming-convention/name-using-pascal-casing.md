# Use PacalCasing for title
Use [PascalCasing](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Pascal-case) as that well make your work in PowerApps so much easier. I even suggest that you always suffix the subject of your list with the word "List" - In this case name the list "MyFirstList"

Rename the list to a human readable format by adding the necessary spaces, then click **save**
