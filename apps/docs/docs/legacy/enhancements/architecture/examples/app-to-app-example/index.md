## Use case
:::info 
As a good colleague, I like to be able to easily setup a coffee meeting with peers in order to retain a good social relationship.

import BoxWithShadow from '@site/src/components/BoxWithShadow'

## Architecture
### Assumptions

You find your peers in a Lists. Each peer report their whereabouts in another List. The handling of WhereAbouts is not covered here.

Coffee orders will be stored in a list.
### Data model
<BoxWithShadow caption="Datamodel">

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Peers ||--o{ WhereAbout : userId
    WhereAbout {
        userId string
        available date 
    }
    User ||--o{ Peers : "Relates to"
    User ||--o{ CoffeeOrder : Order
    CoffeeOrder{
        when    date
        quantity    number
    } 
    
            
```

</BoxWithShadow>

### Application Flow

<BoxWithShadow>


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor You
    participant Peers
    participant Coffee
    participant Office365
    participant Lists
    You->>Peers: Start app
    Office365->>Peers: User
    note over Peers: When you start the Peers app you are automatically signed in
    You->>Peers: Look for Johns whereabout
    Peers->>+Lists: John at work today?
    Lists->>+Peers: Yes he is!
    You->>Peers: Order coffee
    Peers->>+You: Redirected to Coffee App
    Office365->>Coffee: User
    Peers->>Coffee: Peer John
    note over Coffee: App knows who you are and that you like to drink coffee with John
    Coffee->>+Lists: Order stored
    note over Coffee: Order have been made and can be picked up by a an app or a service
    
```
</BoxWithShadow>

#### Steps

1. You launch the app
2. You are automatically signed in
3. You look for Johns whereabout
4. List is query
5. Assuming John is where you will be
6. You start coffee order process
7. You are automatically redirected to the Buy Coffee app
8. You are automatically signed in (again)
9. Your peer is read from the Param function
10. Order is posted

## My Peers application
The peer application gives you easy access to the whereabouts of your peers. 

So when you find a peer, you have the option for inviting for a cup of coffee.

Ordering coffee is done in Buy Coffee app
### Screen interactions
