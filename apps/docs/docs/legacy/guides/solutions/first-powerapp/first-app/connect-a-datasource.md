# Connect the List to your App

Head back to your PowerApps.

In my case, I opened Teams in a new browser tab, so all I have to do is to select the first tab.

## Open the "Data" panel 
![](2022-09-22-14-52-26.png)
Within the left rail (marked by the surrounding read box), select the database icon ![](2022-09-22-14-53-27.png)

Select Add data ![](2022-09-22-14-54-39.png)

Select **Connect directly (cloud service)**

Here it becomes tricky. Once you are presented with the **Connect to SharePoint site** panel, you have two options. You can either 1) enter the SharePoint URL or 2) select amongst Recent sites. The latter is super handy, but as the list of recent sites have a built-in delay, it will not recognize lists you have just created (which are stored in a site, which is created automatically when you create a Microsoft Team) 

In this case, I have cheated and waited a day for the list to get updated with the Teams that I created earlier. If you haven't got that patience, check
