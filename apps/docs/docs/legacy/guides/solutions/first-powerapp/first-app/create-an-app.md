# Create an App
An app can consist of either one or multiple screens. 

:::info
You can make one or multi-screen applications. Selecting multi-screen applications requires consideration concerning what needs to be shared across screens, e.g., navigation.
:::

We typically suggest to make "One screen" apps for the main flow and supporting screens for settings etc.

## Open PowerApps Designer
Navigate to https://make.powerapps.com/ (You might be asked to sign in) Eventually you will end up with a screen looking like this
