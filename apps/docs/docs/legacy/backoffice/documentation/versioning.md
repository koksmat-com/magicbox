Versioning

The main driver for using GitHub as the place to store and track is versioning. 

:::info
Git is a distributed version control system. This means that every team member has got a local store that contains all the source code of a project, including the complete history of all changes of all files. This store is called a ‘repository’ and it is located in a hidden folder ‘.git’ on the local file system.
